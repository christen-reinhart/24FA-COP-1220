Summary: This article examines how fentanyl has spread to every corner of the United States, contributing to overdose deaths and destroying families and communities. It describes how, at first, people did not want fentanyl, but it became increasingly prevalent due to the low cost. The low price has enabled the opioid epidemic to spread within communities that are not traditionally impacted. This has been described as a blind spot, especially as fentanyl has been laced into a multitude of street drugs. The author gives relevant statistics and national insights into the crisis, making it a good source for gaining a grasp of the scope of the issue.
Evaluation: This source will enable me to emphasize the nationwide impact of the fentanyl crisis by utilizing statistical data and public health perspectives. It will serve as a basis for discussing the far-reaching societal impacts, stressing how fentanyl has destroyed communities across the U.S., crossing state and racial lines with neither impunity nor bias.
