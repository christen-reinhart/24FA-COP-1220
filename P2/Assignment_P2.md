Drip Ybor City, Tampa, Florida
October 13, 2024

Drip is a creative studio located in the historical district of Ybor in Tampa, Florida. The studio focuses on hands-on artistic experiences, mostly with pottery and ceramics, and has a laid-back atmosphere designed to inspire creativity and artistic expression. Drip stands for “Do Really Inspirational Projects” and its mission is to foster a creative and artistic environment. From the moment you walk in, you can tell the environment is very unique, and since it is in Ybor there is an amazing variety of individuals frequenting the establishment, further contributing to your experience. Originally, my wife and I went to Drip as a “date night” experience to try something new that neither of us had done before. We enjoyed this time together, and the unique, laid-back venue located in the historic district, with all the brick buildings and streets, contributed to the time we spent stepping outside our comfort zone. For individuals or even couples, Drip is the perfect place to try something new and creative. It is a one-of-a-kind small business that is unique to the historic district of Ybor. While you are there, you can also visit many other unique small businesses. Just be sure to wear clothes you aren't afraid to get dirty, and if you plan to visit other places in Ybor, it might be best to visit them first, as you’ll likely get some clay on yourself through the creative process.
