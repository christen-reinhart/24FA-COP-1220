Program Overview
Purpose: This program takes two double (floating-point) numbers as input from the user, adds them together, divides the sum by 2 (calculates their average), and outputs the result.
Symbolic constant: The program uses a symbolic constant (DIVISOR) to represent the value 2.0, which is used for dividing the sum of the two numbers.

This line seems like an incorrect shebang (#!/usr/bin/env) typically used for scripting languages like Python, Bash, etc., but in C programs, it has no effect. It can be removed or changed as it's not necessary here.
