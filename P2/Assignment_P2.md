For my third speech, I will be discussing the alarming issue of the interest on the national debt surpassing $1 trillion and why this matters for future generations. This milestone is significant as it marks the first time that interest payments on the national debt have exceeded defense spending in U.S. history. The growing national debt and the associated interest payments will likely have long-term consequences on economic stability and the financial burden on future taxpayers. The debate centers on government fiscal policies, increased deficit spending, and the sustainability of carrying such high levels of debt. This topic is crucial for the younger generations who will inherit this debt and its accompanying challenges, and I will explore how continued fiscal irresponsibility could limit future opportunities and exacerbate economic inequality.
