Zibbell, Jon E., et al. "Association of Law Enforcement Seizures of Heroin, Fentanyl, and Alfentanil with Opioid Overdose Deaths in Ohio, 2014-2017." JAMA Network Open, vol. 2, no. 11, 8 Nov. 2019, e1914666, doi:10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2019.14666. https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/article-abstract/2754249. Accessed 15 Oct. 2024.
Summary: This research paper investigates the correlation between law enforcement confiscations of opioids (heroin, fentanyl, and carfentanil) and the rise in overdose deaths in Ohio from 2014 to 2017. The study demonstrates a strong relationship between the rise in drug seizures and the growing number of opioid-related fatalities. It underscores the significant role of fentanyl and carfentanil as leading contributors to overdose deaths. Combining data from Ohio's Bureau of Criminal Investigation and the Ohio Department of Health, the authors demonstrate the possibility of utilizing law enforcement seizure data as an early warning system to inform public health responses to the opioid crisis.
Evaluation: This source offers accurate data and in-depth analysis based on the numbers, making it a reliable and invaluable resource for exploring the correlation between opioid supply and health impacts on citizens. It will strengthen my discussion of the opioid crisis by providing solid evidence that links fentanyl presence to overdose deaths, emphasizing the importance of organized public health and law enforcement to address the situation.

Summary: This article examines how fentanyl has spread to every corner of the United States, contributing to overdose deaths and destroying families and communities. It outlines the public health impacts and the growing role fentanyl plays in the opioid crisis. The article provides current statistics and national insights into the epidemic, making it a reputable source for grasping the scope of the issue.
Evaluation: This source will enable me to emphasize the nationwide impact of the fentanyl crisis by utilizing statistical data and public health perspectives. It will serve as a basis for discussing the far-reaching societal impacts, stressing how fentanyl has destroyed communities across the U.S., crossing state and racial lines with neither impunity nor bias.

Ingoglia, Charles. "Addressing the Nation's Surging Overdose Crisis." National Council for Mental Wellbeing, www.thenationalcouncil.org/addressing-the-nations-surging-overdose-crisis. Accessed 12 Oct. 2024.
Summary: In this article, Charles Ingoglia discusses the worsening overdose crisis in the U.S., illustrating the CDC report of a record 100,307 overdose deaths within the one year ending in April 2021. Synthetic opioids, especially fentanyl, are identified as the primary driver behind this surge, responsible for up to 64% of all overdose deaths. Ingoglia emphasizes the risks of fentanyl's potency and its common occurrence in the drug supply without users' being aware, significantly increasing the risk of overdose. He promotes harm reduction measures, including safe injection sites, distribution of naloxone, and federal assistance through efforts like the American Rescue Plan, which gave $30 million to drug prevention programs. He called for immediate and decisive action from all tiers of government to address this deepening public health crisis.
Evaluation: This article provides reputable and trustworthy insights from a prominent mental health organization, emphasizing the importance of harm mitigation strategies in combating the overdose epidemic. Incorporating recent data and policy measures, such as the American Rescue Plan, enhances its value for discussing the immediate and long-term solutions to the crisis. I will use this source to frame the significance of harm reduction and policy steps in combating the fentanyl crisis, offering a solid basis for discussing both immediate and long-term solutions.

Summary: This article outlines how Oregon and Washington are approaching the fentanyl crisis by recommending new legislation and expanding naloxone availability. Governors in both states have acted, with Washington's governor suggesting a $64 million budget increase to address opioid addiction, while Oregon is thinking of declaring a fentanyl emergency. Native American groups are excessively affected by the crisis, experiencing opioid overdose rates four times higher than the state average. The article also explores legislative measures aimed at lowering public drug use and expanding rehabilitation options, particularly for incarcerated individuals.
Evaluation: This article details a crucial regional viewpoint on how state governments deal with the fentanyl crisis, supplementing national data with localized efforts. It offers valuable insight into how disadvantaged communities, particularly Native Americans, are overwhelmingly affected. I will utilize this source to demonstrate the importance of both regional and local responses in confronting specific dimensions of the fentanyl crisis, supporting my broader argument on the multi-level impacts of the fentanyl crisis.
