Introduction

The fentanyl crisis is a growing epidemic that has claimed countless lives and shattered families across the nation, including our own community. With over 100,000 overdose deaths in the U.S. in 2021, many involving fentanyl, itâ€™s clear that traditional approaches to addiction treatment may not be enough to address the unique challenges posed by opioid use disorder. While 12-step programs like Alcoholics Anonymous (A.A.) offer valuable support, they often fall short in addressing the powerful physical and psychological hold opioids have on individuals. Harm reduction strategies and medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD) provide alternative, evidence-based methods that can supplement these programs, offering hope to those like my friend Brian, who have struggled to find lasting recovery. This paper explores the critical need for comprehensive, compassionate approaches that combine traditional recovery models with innovative medical treatments to save lives, reduce harm, and foster sustainable recovery for individuals, families, and communities impacted by the fentanyl crisis.
