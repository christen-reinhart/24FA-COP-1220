Tonigan, J. Scott. “Spirituality and Alcoholics Anonymous.” Southern Medical Journal, vol. 100, no. 4, 2007, pp. 437-440.

Summary: This article discusses the spiritually based program of Alcoholics Anonymous (AA), particularly its reliance on the concept of God or a higher power in 11 of its 12 steps. The author highlights the mixed opinions surrounding AA’s efficacy, noting that while some believe it is the most effective treatment for alcoholism, others argue that only a small percentage of attendees benefit. Additionally, the article explores the controversial nature of mandated AA attendance and its spiritual components. Tonigan concludes that spirituality has an indirect effect on abstinence by fostering sustained engagement in AA, which promotes recovery over time.

Evaluation: This source will help me discuss the role of spirituality in recovery programs like AA, especially in examining how spiritual practices can contribute to long-term sobriety. The article provides valuable insights into the indirect benefits of spirituality, which I can use to argue how faith-based programs have a unique impact on individuals seeking recovery from addiction.
