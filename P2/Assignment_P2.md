Introduction

The fentanyl crisis is a devastating epidemic that has claimed countless lives, leaving a profound impact on families and communities across the nation, including our own. With over 100,000 overdose deaths in the U.S. in 2021—many involving fentanyl—it’s evident that traditional addiction treatments alone often fall short in addressing the unique challenges posed by opioid use disorder. While 12-step programs like Alcoholics Anonymous (A.A.) offer valuable support, they may not fully address the physical dependency that opioids create. Harm reduction strategies and medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD) provide alternative, evidence-based approaches that supplement traditional programs, offering a more comprehensive path to recovery. The fentanyl crisis has devastated numerous individuals, families, and communities, creating an urgent need for compassionate, evidence-based approaches to addiction treatment, including 12-step programs and MOUD, to save lives, reduce harm, and foster long-term recovery.
