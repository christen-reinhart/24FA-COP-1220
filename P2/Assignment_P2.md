In the initial design phase, I focused on the core objective of the program:

Prompting the user to enter positive integers.
Categorizing each integer as either even or odd.
Stopping the input process when a specific value (1212) is entered.
Calculating and displaying the count and average for both even and odd numbers.
Determining which group (even or odd) had more numbers.
To achieve this, I broke down the problem into smaller tasks:

A way to accept numbers in a loop until the user inputs the stop condition.
Logic to differentiate between even and odd numbers.
Variables to count and sum the even and odd numbers separately.
A mechanism to calculate the average only if there are numbers in the respective category (even or odd).
Conditional logic to determine the "winner" based on which group had more entries.
