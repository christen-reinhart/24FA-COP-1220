Summary: This article goes into the way we handle addiction treatment in the United States, explicitly referring to the opioid overdose crisis. The writers argue that outdated abstinence-only models are being used in the treatment industry despite the growing number of overdose deaths. They call for the use of medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD) and the need for harm reduction strategies in the field of recovery assistance. This can be done with the distribution of naloxone, syringe exchange programs, and overdose prevention sites. The authors also need to highlight the resistance to these scientifically supported methods. They are noting that federal drug policies are starting to move in this direction, favoring harm reduction strategies.

Evaluation: After reading this article, I believe it is a good resource for exploring addiction treatment challenges faced in the United States, specifically regarding opioid overdose prevention. The authors give evidence supporting harm reduction approaches in their thorough review of this topic and offer practical recommendations for healthcare providers and politicians. The way it focuses the research makes it helpful regarding healthcare, harm reduction, and public policy. It is relevant to talk about the various barriers that need to be addressed, such as regulatory and stigma, making it essential to discuss treatment reforms.
