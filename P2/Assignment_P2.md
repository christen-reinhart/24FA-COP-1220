Speech 2 Proposal
The Right to Disconnect: Balancing Work and Personal Life
20241025

For my second speech, I will be discussing the introduction of “right to disconnect” laws. Recently, in countries like Belgium, France, Spain, and Australia, discussions around work-life balance have gained traction. These discussions revolve around laws giving employees the legal right to separate communications that are work-related from personal communications on their own time. Australia’s Minister for Employment advocates for the legislation, putting emphasis on protecting employees’ personal time, while Kevin O’ Leary expresses concern about being able to reach employees at times that are important. California has attempted to pass legislation in 2024 and highlights the interest in the topic. I find this topic personally interesting since it relates to my cybersecurity degree. This is primarily since in my field we can be responsible for securing Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) telecommunication equipment and the data associated with them. I think this is a topic that that could be important as we transition back to in person working as well and employers maybe use to getting a hold of employees outside the normal business hours on their cell phone.
