This is the third Theory assignment (see syllabus). For this assignment, you will not be writing code. Instead, you will write sentences and paragraphs to answer the items below. When preparing your responses, please spell-check and grammar-check your work. Make sure your work has a professional appearance. Be thorough and detailed as you answer the questions. You should use various sources as you gather information. Be sure that you do NOT copy and paste from these sources. Instead, synthesize the information and present it using your own words. You must CITE (using any format) the sources you use. Number your responses, and separate the paragraphs so that I can easily figure out which of your responses go with which questions.

Q1: Provide three specific examples of when you might use arrays in your C programs. It should be clear from the examples you give that they would be best approached by using arrays (give details to make it clear why arrays would be appropriate).

Q2: Find a C program on the web that uses an array. Give a link to the program’s source code, and tell what the program does. Copy and paste the code that defines the array and describe what you think the array is used for.

Q3: Name three specific examples where 2-dimensional arrays would be appropriate.

Q4: What are pointers? How can they be used with arrays? 

(Be sure to use the T3 Dropbox for this assignment.)

Q1: Provide three specific examples of when you might use arrays in your C programs.
1.	Storing and Processing a List of Scores: Suppose you're creating a program that calculates the average score of students in a class. You can use an array to store all the scores, allowing you to iterate through the array, calculate the sum, and then divide by the number of students to get the average. Arrays are appropriate here because you need to manage a collection of related data (scores) and perform operations on each element in the sequence.
2.	Tracking Daily Temperatures: In a weather-tracking application, you could use an array to store daily temperature readings for a week (or longer). Arrays make it easy to access specific days by their index (e.g., the temperature on day 3), and they allow for efficient iteration to calculate averages or detect trends, such as the highest or lowest temperature over the period.
3.	Handling a Deck of Cards in a Game: In a card game, you can use an array to represent a deck of 52 cards. Each element in the array would correspond to a unique card (e.g., array[0] = "Ace of Spades"). This setup allows you to shuffle the deck, deal cards to players, and easily track which cards have been played.

Q2: Find a C program on the web that uses an array.
1.	Link to Source Code: You can find C programs with arrays on various coding websites. Here is an example of a C program that uses arrays:
Example Link: C Program for Bubble Sort
Array Definition:
c
Copy code
int arr[100];
2.	
○	This line defines an array called arr with a maximum size of 100 elements. The array is used to store integers that need to be sorted using the bubble sort algorithm. In this program, the array allows for easy swapping of elements to reorder them in ascending or descending order.

Q3: Name three specific examples where 2-dimensional arrays would be appropriate.
1.	Representing a Chess Board: A chess board can be represented as an 8x8 grid, where each cell holds information about the piece at that position (e.g., empty, pawn, knight). A 2D array allows easy access to any piece by specifying its row and column.
2.	Storing Image Pixel Data: Images are often represented as grids of pixels. A 2D array can store the color values (e.g., RGB values) of each pixel, allowing for image processing operations such as filtering, cropping, or resizing.
3.	Managing a Table of Data: In a spreadsheet-like application, where you store data in rows and columns (such as sales data across multiple months and regions), a 2D array is ideal for organizing and accessing this structured data.

Q4: What are pointers? How can they be used with arrays?
Pointers in C are variables that store the memory addresses of other variables. Instead of storing a value directly, a pointer "points" to the location in memory where a value is stored. Pointers are essential in C because they allow for dynamic memory management and can be used to manipulate data stored in arrays and other structures.
Using Pointers with Arrays:
●	Arrays in C are closely related to pointers. When you declare an array, the array name itself acts as a pointer to the first element in the array. For example, if you have an array int arr[5];, arr is a pointer to arr[0].
●	You can use pointers to iterate through an array using pointer arithmetic. For example, *(arr + i) will give you the value of the ith element of the array.
●	Pointers allow you to pass arrays to functions efficiently because instead of copying the entire array, you pass a pointer to the first element, which is much faster and conserves memory.
