Summary: This article takes a hard look at the current state of addiction treatment in the United States, particularly in the context of the opioid overdose crisis. The authors argue that despite the growing number of overdose deaths, the addiction treatment industry still largely depends on outdated abstinence-only models. They emphasize the need for harm reduction strategies, such as the use of medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD), distribution of naloxone, syringe exchange programs, and overdose prevention sites. Additionally, the authors highlight the resistance to these scientifically supported methods, while noting that federal drug policies are slowly starting to favor more harm reduction strategies.

Evaluation: The article serves as a valuable resource for exploring the challenges of addiction treatment in the U.S., especially regarding opioid overdose prevention. The authors provide a thorough review of the evidence supporting harm reduction approaches and offer practical recommendations for policymakers and healthcare providers. This makes it particularly useful for research that focuses on the intersection of healthcare, public policy, and harm reduction. The article also effectively addresses the obstacles posed by stigma and regulatory barriers, making it relevant to discussions about reforming addiction treatment practices.
