Q2: Find a C program on the web that uses an array. Give a link to the programâ€™s source code and tell what the program does. Copy and paste the code that defines the array and describe what you think the array is used for.

I found a C program that demonstrates using arrays to calculate the average of four integers. The program is available on Programiz: 
PROGRAMIZ

Program Overview: This program prompts the user to input four integers, stores them in an array, and then calculates and displays their average.

Array Definition in the Program:
int num[4];

Purpose of the Array: The num array is defined to hold four integer values entered by the user. Each element of the array corresponds to one of the integers. By storing the integers in an array, the program can efficiently iterate through the elements to compute the sum and, subsequently, the average. This approach simplifies the process of handling multiple related variables and allows for scalable code that can be easily modified to accommodate more numbers if needed.
