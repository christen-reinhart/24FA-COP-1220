An annotated bibliography is a great way to summarize and evaluate the sources you'll be using in your "Social Issues Letter." It usually consists of citations followed by a summary and analysis of each source. The summary should cover the main points, while the analysis should explain how the source supports your letter.
Here’s a breakdown of how to create an annotated bibliography:
Steps to Create an Annotated Bibliography:
1.	Find Your Sources:
o	You’ll need at least two sources:
	One popular source (e.g., news articles, magazine articles).
	One academic source (e.g., scholarly journal articles).
2.	Cite the Sources:
o	Use MLA or APA format, whichever is required for your assignment.
3.	Summarize Each Source:
o	Provide a brief description of the content and key arguments of the source (2-4 sentences).
4.	Evaluate Each Source:
o	Assess the source’s credibility and relevance to your argument.
o	Mention how it will help support your letter (2-3 sentences).
Example (MLA Style)
Popular Source:
Citation: Jones, Amy. “The Fentanyl Crisis in America: Causes and Solutions.” The New York Times, 5 Mar. 2023, www.nytimes.com/fentanyl-crisis.
Annotation: This article discusses the increasing number of fentanyl-related deaths in the U.S., focusing on how the opioid is often mixed with other drugs, leading to accidental overdoses. Jones argues that stronger regulation and public awareness campaigns are necessary to combat this crisis. This source will help me provide a current overview of the scope of the fentanyl epidemic and emphasize the need for public health interventions.
Academic Source:
Citation: Smith, John M. “Fentanyl and Opioid Addiction: A Public Health Approach.” Journal of Public Health Studies, vol. 48, no. 2, 2022, pp. 135-152.
Annotation: Smith’s study explores the public health impact of fentanyl, emphasizing the need for harm reduction strategies such as safe injection sites and increased access to treatment programs. The article also provides statistical data on the rise in overdose deaths. This academic source will support my letter by giving evidence-based solutions to the fentanyl crisis, helping me make a more persuasive argument about public health strategies.

Cameron, Hugh. “Republicans Urge Democrats to Pass Fentanyl Legislation Amid Drug Addiction Crisis.” Newsweek, 7 Oct. 2024, www.newsweek.com/republicans-urge-democrats-pass-fentanyl-legislation-drug-addiction-1964747. Accessed 12 Oct. 2024.
In this article, Hugh Cameron reports on the growing tensions in Congress over the fentanyl crisis, with Republicans urging Senate Democrats to pass the HALT Fentanyl Act. The bill, which aims to make permanent the class-wide scheduling of fentanyl and related substances, has been stalled in the Senate despite bipartisan support. Republicans argue the bill would help reduce fentanyl deaths by giving Customs and Border Protection more authority to seize the drug. However, Democrats and NGOs oppose certain provisions, such as mandatory minimum sentences, which they believe would exacerbate the issue of over-incarceration and hinder research into fentanyl’s medical potential.
