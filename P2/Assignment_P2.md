Ingoglia, Charles. “Addressing the Nation’s Surging Overdose Crisis.” National Council for Mental Wellbeing, www.thenationalcouncil.org/addressing-the-nations-surging-overdose-crisis. Accessed 12 Oct. 2024.

Summary: In this article, Charles Ingoglia addresses the growing overdose crisis in the U.S., with the CDC reporting a record 100,307 overdose deaths within a 12-month span ending in April 2021. Synthetic opioids, particularly fentanyl, are identified as the main driver behind this surge, contributing to 64% of all overdose deaths. Ingoglia emphasizes the dangers of fentanyl’s potency and its frequent presence in the drug supply without users’ knowledge, heightening overdose risks. He advocates for harm reduction strategies, such as safe injection sites, naloxone distribution, and federal support via policies like the American Rescue Plan, which allocated $30 million to overdose prevention programs. Ingoglia calls for immediate and bold action from all levels of government to combat this escalating public health emergency.

Evaluation: This article offers credible and authoritative insights from a leading mental health organization, underscoring the urgency of harm reduction strategies in combating the overdose crisis. The inclusion of recent data and policy initiatives, such as the American Rescue Plan, strengthens its value as a resource for discussing both the immediate and long-term responses to the crisis. I will use this article to frame the importance of harm reduction and policy interventions in addressing the fentanyl epidemic, providing a solid foundation for discussing both local and national solutions.
