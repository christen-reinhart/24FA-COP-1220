Introduction:

Dear [Recipient’s Name],

I’ve been thinking a lot about something that’s been heavy on my heart, and I wanted to take the time to share it with you. The fentanyl crisis has taken so many lives in our country, but it’s not until you lose someone close that it truly hits home. Miles was someone we both knew, someone who had fought hard to overcome his addiction. He made it through rehabilitation, and for a moment, there was hope. But as quickly as that hope came, it was ripped away. After a relapse, he overdosed on fentanyl, leaving behind a family, a daughter who will now grow up without her father, and a community that mourns yet another life lost too soon.

The fentanyl epidemic isn’t just a news story—it’s real, and it’s devastating families like Miles’. I feel the need to talk about this, not only because of the grief we share but also because we, as a community, need to understand the gravity of what’s happening around us. This crisis doesn’t just impact those who are addicted; it leaves a trail of broken families and shattered communities in its wake. I want to explore not only what this means for all of us but also what we can do to stop this from happening to more families.
