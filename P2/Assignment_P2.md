Rush, Claire, and Hallie Golden. “Fentanyl Crisis Impacting Oregon and Washington Legislatures.” AP News, 13 Dec. 2023, www.apnews.com/article/fentanyl-opioids-oregon-washington-legislature-2db8e01e0cdc26fb72f119fe99cdb73a. Accessed 12 Oct. 2024.

Summary: This article highlights how the states of Oregon and Washington are responding to the fentanyl crisis by proposing new legislation and increasing naloxone availability. Governors in both states have taken action, with Washington’s governor proposing a $64 million budget increase to combat opioid addiction, and Oregon considering declaring a fentanyl emergency. Native American communities are particularly affected by the crisis, with opioid overdose rates four times the state average. The article also discusses legislative efforts to reduce public drug use and expand treatment options, especially for incarcerated individuals.

Evaluation: This article provides a valuable regional perspective on how state governments are addressing the fentanyl crisis, complementing national data with local efforts. It offers insight into how marginalized communities, particularly Native Americans, are disproportionately affected. I will use this source to showcase how localized responses are crucial in addressing specific aspects of the fentanyl crisis, enriching my broader argument about the national and local impacts of the epidemic.
