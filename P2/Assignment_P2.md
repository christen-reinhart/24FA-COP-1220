Program Overview
Purpose: This program takes two double (floating-point) numbers as input from the user, adds them together, divides the sum by 2 (calculates their average), and outputs the result.
Symbolic constant: The program uses a symbolic constant (DIVISOR) to represent the value 2.0, which is used for dividing the sum of the two numbers.
Line-by-Line Explanation

Copy code
// !/usr/bin/env Program C
This line seems like an incorrect shebang (#!/usr/bin/env) typically used for scripting languages like Python, Bash, etc., but in C programs, it has no effect. It can be removed or changed as it's not necessary here.

Script name: Programming C P6_1
Author: Christen Reinhart
Date: Last revised on 09/28/2024
Purpose: The program adds two numbers and divides the sum by 2.
Input: Describes that variables are declared and values are input by the user.
Output: The result of the sum divided by two is displayed.
c
Copy code
#include <stdio.h>
This line includes the standard input/output library (stdio.h). This library provides functions like printf and scanf, which are used to handle input and output in C programs.

c
Copy code
// function prototype 
double yongl(double num1, double num2);
This line declares a function prototype for a function named yongl. It specifies that the yongl function will accept two double (floating-point) parameters (num1 and num2) and return a double value. Defining the prototype here ensures that the compiler knows about the function before its actual definition.

c
Copy code
// symbolic constant 
#define DIVISOR 2.0
This defines a symbolic constant called DIVISOR with the value 2.0. The #define preprocessor directive is used here, which means every occurrence of DIVISOR in the code will be replaced with 2.0 during compilation. This helps improve code readability and maintainability, as changing DIVISOR in one place will update it throughout the program.

c
Copy code
int main() {
This is the beginning of the main function, which is the entry point of every C program. The function returns an integer (int) value, which is typically used to indicate the success or failure of the program when it finishes execution.

c
Copy code
    // declare variables
    double value1, value2, result;
Here, three double variables are declared:

value1: This will store the first number entered by the user.
value2: This will store the second number entered by the user.
result: This will store the result returned from the yongl function.
c
Copy code
    // user input
    printf("Enter the first number: ");
    scanf("%lf", &value1);
This block prompts the user to enter the first number:

printf: Prints the message "Enter the first number: " to the console.
scanf: Reads the userâ€™s input and stores it in the variable value1. The format specifier %lf is used to read a double value (long float).
c
Copy code
    printf("Enter the second number: ");
    scanf("%lf", &value2);
Similarly, this block prompts the user to enter the second number:

printf: Displays "Enter the second number: ".
scanf: Reads the user input and stores it in the variable value2.
c
Copy code
    // Call yongl function then store 
    result = yongl(value1, value2);
This line calls the yongl function, passing the values value1 and value2 as arguments. The result (the average of the two numbers) is stored in the result variable.

yongl(value1, value2): The function yongl is called with value1 and value2 as arguments, and the result of its execution (the average) is stored in result.
c
Copy code
    // display result
    printf("The result of yongl is: %.2lf\n", result);
This line displays the result:

printf: Prints the message "The result of yongl is: " followed by the value of result.
%.2lf: The format specifier %.2lf ensures that the double value is printed with two decimal places.
c
Copy code
    return 0;
This line ends the main function and returns 0, which indicates that the program has successfully executed.

c
Copy code
}
This curly brace closes the main function.

c
Copy code
// function for yongl
double yongl(double num1, double num2) {
This is the definition of the yongl function. It takes two double arguments, num1 and num2, and returns a double value (the average of the two numbers).

c
Copy code
    // calculate average
    double sum = num1 + num2;
    double average = sum / DIVISOR;
This block performs the calculation:

sum = num1 + num2;: The sum of num1 and num2 is calculated and stored in the variable sum.
average = sum / DIVISOR;: The sum is divided by the symbolic constant DIVISOR (which is 2.0), calculating the average, and this value is stored in average.
c
Copy code
    // return result
    return average;
This line returns the calculated average to the caller (the main function).

c
Copy code
}
This curly brace closes the yongl function.

c
Copy code
// end
This comment marks the end of the program for readability purposes.

Summary of the Program's Functionality
The program prompts the user to input two numbers.
It calls the yongl function, which:
Adds the two numbers.
Divides the sum by 2 (using the symbolic constant DIVISOR).
Returns the result.
The program then displays the result (the average of the two numbers)
