Zibbell, Jon E., et al. "Association of Law Enforcement Seizures of Heroin, Fentanyl, and Alfentanil with Opioid Overdose Deaths in Ohio, 2014-2017." JAMA Network Open, vol. 2, no. 11, 8 Nov. 2019, e1914666, doi:10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2019.14666. https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/article-abstract/2754249. Accessed 15 Oct. 2024.

Summary: This research letter investigates the link between law enforcement seizures of opioids (heroin, fentanyl, and carfentanil) and the rise in overdose deaths in Ohio from 2014 to 2017. The study reveals a significant correlation between the increase in drug seizures and the surge in opioid-related fatalities, highlighting the role of fentanyl and carfentanil as primary contributors to overdose deaths. By integrating data from Ohioâ€™s Bureau of Criminal Investigation and the Ohio Department of Health, the authors demonstrate the potential of using law enforcement seizure data as an early warning system for public health responses to opioid crises.

Evaluation: This source provides empirical data and strong statistical analysis, making it a credible and invaluable resource for examining the relationship between opioid supply and public health outcomes. It will support my discussion of the opioid crisis by offering specific evidence linking fentanyl availability to overdose deaths, reinforcing the importance of coordinated public health and law enforcement efforts to mitigate the crisis.
