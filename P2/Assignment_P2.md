24/FA COP-1220-93444 Programming in C  
P8

1a. Design, code, and test a C program that reads input as a stream of characters until the value EOF is encountered (hint: use redirection). Have the program report the total number of uppercase characters, total number of lowercase characters, and total number of punctuation characters read. (You can use the functions in ctype.h for this assignment.) Use the attached file infile.txt as input when you submit your assignment. (80 points)

Infile.txt is below
When the crypt goes creak,
And the tombstones quake.
Spooks come out for a swinging wake.
Happy haunts materialize,
And begin to vocalize.
Grim grinning ghosts come out to socialize.

Now don't close your eyes,
And don't try to hide.
Or a silly spook may sit by your side.
Shrouded in a daft disguise,
They pretend to terrorize.
Grim grinning ghosts come out to socialize.

As the moon climbs high o'er the dead oak tree,
Spooks arrive for the midnight spree.
Creepy creeps with eerie eyes,
Start to shriek and harmonize.
Grim grinning ghosts come out to socialize.

When you hear the knell of a requiem bell,
Weird glows gleam where spirits dwell.
Restless bones etherialize,
Rise as spooks of every size.

If you would like to join our jamboree,
There's a simple rule that's compulsory. Mortals pay a token fee.
Rest in peace, the haunting's free.
So hurry back, we would like your company.

1b. How did you approach the development of the program in part a? Explain how you designed, coded, and tested the program. What challenges did you have and how did you overcome those challenges? Which code from the textbook did you reference as you developed this one? (be specific) (20 points)
