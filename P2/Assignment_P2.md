Summary: This article goes into the way we handle addiction treatment in the United States, explicitly referring to the opioid overdose crisis. The writers argue that outdated abstinence-only models are being used in the treatment industry despite the growing number of overdose deaths due to long-held beliefs by treatment professionals. This stems from America's long-standing support for groups like Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) and the 12-step model, which calls for abstinence. Due to some of the stigma attached to AA and the urgent need to address the opioid crisis, they call for the use of medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD) and the need for harm reduction strategies in the field of recovery assistance. This can be done with the distribution of naloxone, syringe exchange programs, and overdose prevention sites. The authors also need to highlight the resistance to these scientifically supported methods. They are noting that federal drug policies are starting to move in this direction, favoring harm reduction strategies.
Evaluation: This article is a resource necessary for exploring addiction treatment challenges faced in the United States, specifically regarding opioid overdose prevention. What made this article stick out to me is how it challenges the traditional 12-step AA-type method, particularly the abstinence-only approach. The authors give professionally supported evidence for harm reduction approaches in their thorough review of this topic and offer practical recommendations for healthcare providers and policymakers. The article's research makes it particularly helpful regarding nontraditional solutions to the epidemic in healthcare, harm reduction, and public policy. It is relevant in the discussion about the various barriers that need to be addressed, such as regulations and stigma, making it essential to treatment reforms.
