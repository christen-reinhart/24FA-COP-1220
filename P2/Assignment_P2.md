1a. Design, code, and test a program that accepts positive integers until the special value 1212 is entered. After input terminates, the program should report the total number of even integers (excluding the special value) , the average value of the even integers, the total number of odd integers, and the average value of the odd integers. The program should also report "Yippee, the evens won!",  "Wowee, the odds prevailed!", or "Yikes, it was a tie!" based on the results. Test your program thoroughly and submit output with at least 10 integers as input. Make sure your loop is a structured loop (refer to COP 1000 priming read/priming input). (80 points)

1b. How did you approach the development of the program in part a? Explain how you designed, coded, and tested the program. What challenges did you have and how did you overcome those challenges? Which code from the textbook did you reference as you developed this one? (be specific) (20 points)
