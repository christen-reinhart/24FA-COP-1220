1a. Design, code, and test a C program that reads input as a stream of characters until the value EOF is encountered (hint: use redirection). Have the program report the total number of uppercase characters, total number of lowercase characters, and total number of punctuation characters read. (You can use the functions in ctype.h for this assignment.) Use the attached file infile.txt as input when you submit your assignment. (80 points)
