Introduction
The fentanyl crisis is an existential threat that has claimed countless lives, leaving a destructive impact on families and communities across the country. With over 100,000 overdose deaths in the U.S. in 2021, many involving fentanyl, it has become evident that traditional addiction treatments are falling short in addressing the unique challenges presented by opioid use disorder. While traditional 12-step programs like Alcoholics Anonymous (A.A.) and Narcotics Anonymous (N.A.) offer fantastic group and individual support, they may not fully address the physical dependency that opioids present. Medications for Opioid Use Disorder (MOUD) and harm reduction strategies provide alternative, evidence-based approaches that complement traditional programs, providing a more comprehensive road to recovery and a better quality of life. The fentanyl crisis has devastated numerous individuals, families, and communities, creating an urgent need for compassionate, evidence-based approaches to addiction treatment, including 12-step programs and MOUD, to save lives, reduce harm, and foster long-term recovery.

Dear Brian,
I have been thinking about you and your current condition, especially after your current relapse. I know how much you have struggled with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) while staying sober, and all I can think about is the growing crisis around us with substance abuse taking so many lives of people we know and care about. Not sure if you remember Miles? I was in treatment with him, and he struggled so much, going in and out of Turning Point, but after multiple attempts at recovery, fentanyl took his life. His death devastated his family, especially his daughter, and it is painful to see how addiction destroys the lives of those who care most for them.

I know you have worked a 12-step recovery program through Alcoholics Anonymous (A.A.) in the past. These traditional programs do work for some individuals. However, they may not fully address the amount of support needed to overcome addiction to opioids, especially when working to overcome the physical and mental aspects. That is why I wanted to talk about another approach that I have heard about harm reduction strategies and medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD). While no solution is perfect, it provides additional relief to address the physical cravings and psychological challenges of addiction. 

The Fentanyl Crisis and Its Impact
Fentanyl is moving through communities across the U.S., and it is not just in urban areas anymore. In 2021, over 100,000 people died from overdoses, and a lot of those deaths involved fentanyl (Nadine, 2023). This crisis has gotten worse since many users often are not aware they are consuming fentanyl; drug dealers combine it with other drugs, making it more potent and dangerous. Miles’ story of multiple relapses and eventually succumbing to addiction is just one of many examples of how this epidemic can touch us all. Miles went through rehab at Turning Point multiple times, leaving with renewed hope each time. He had a plan, attended his A.A. meetings, got a sponsor and support group, and followed the 12 steps, but for some reason, he could not get over his demons. Even with support from his family and his A.A. home group, he could not get over the emptiness inside, which led to his relapse. His struggle impacted everyone around him, especially those who cared most about him. Addiction does not just negatively impact the individual; it destroys families and communities.

Limitations of 12-Step Programs, Counter Arguments, and Challenges
While 12-step programs like A.A. have helped many people like me, they may not work for everyone, specifically those struggling with addiction to drugs like fentanyl. Programs like A.A. focus on recovery's spiritual and mental aspects, which can be incredibly valuable. However, in some cases, they cannot overcome the powerful grip of dependency on opioids. Fentanyl’s potency means that overcoming its grip requires more than just a support group or a higher power; in some cases, it requires medical intervention initially to manage cravings and withdrawal symptoms. This is where Medications for Opioid Use Disorder (MOUD) can make a difference. However, some argue that MOUD is just a temporary fix for a deeper issue, preferring abstinence-based programs like A.A. for what they view as long-term faith-based recovery. Some worry about implementing MOUD because of how it can prolong dependency rather than sobriety. The reality is that the fentanyl crisis is claiming lives daily. Complete abstinence should be the end goal, but there are multiple ways to get to the same place. Research supports that MOUD saves lives, reduces harm, and offers individuals a chance to rebuild. If Miles had access to this comprehensive support, he might still be here today. The goal should be about keeping people alive, giving them a shot at recovery, and helping them find a better quality of life through their journey.

The Broader Impact of the Fentanyl Crisis
The fentanyl crisis is not just an individual issue; it is a community crisis. Families like Miles’ wife and daughter are left behind to face the emotional and financial impact of addiction. This epidemic burdens not only those close to the person struggling but also healthcare systems, emergency services, and social services. Expanding access to treatments like MOUD, reducing stigma, and supporting harm reduction programs are critical to combating this crisis (Proctor, 2022).

A Case for Medications for Opioid Use Disorder (MOUD)
MOUD approaches addiction differently by addressing the physical aspect. Medications like methadone, buprenorphine, and naltrexone help reduce cravings and withdrawal symptoms, providing a foundation for individuals to regain control over their lives (Proctor, 2022). Studies demonstrate that MOUD significantly reduces overdose risk and improves long-term recovery rates. Some people view MOUD as simply “replacing one drug with another,” these medications are produced to strict medical standards and help people stabilize their lives. If Miles had access to MOUD and his A.A. program, things might have turned out differently. He might still be here today, working on his recovery program and being a good father and husband to his family. Brian, I think it is something you should consider. You have tried A.A., and while it has its benefits, it may not be enough. MOUD, combined with therapy and a support network, could be the key to overcoming that final hurdle.

Conclusion
Brian, I want you to know I believe in you, and you do not have to face this alone. This crisis is overwhelming, but with some practical tools and people who care, you can be successful. Please consider trying a new approach, whether MOUD, individual therapy, faith-based programs, or any other support form. I do not want to see you follow the same trajectory as Miles. Let us work together and get you the vital help you need. At times, addiction can seem like too much to handle alone, utilizing the proper medical support and taking one step at a time with spiritual solutions and people who believe you will be successful in overcoming addiction.
Christen,
