Addiction Research & Theory, vol. 30, no. 4, 2022, pp. 231-236, doi:10.1080/16066359.2021.2007888. https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail/detail?vid=4&sid=642c9843-154f-4672-8a45-5f6eb29c4d94%40redis&bdata=JkF1dGhUeXBlPXNoaWImYXV0aHR5cGU9c2hpYiZzaXRlPWVob3N0LWxpdmU%3d#db=a9h&AN=157908636.

Summary: This article critically examines the current state of addiction treatment in the United States, focusing on the opioid overdose crisis. The authors argue that the American addiction treatment industry continues to rely on outdated abstinence-only models, even as drug overdose deaths escalate. They highlight the need for harm reduction strategies, such as medications for opioid use disorder, naloxone distribution, syringe services, and overdose prevention sites. Additionally, the article discusses the resistance to these evidence-based methods and how federal drug policy is beginning to shift in favor of more significant harm reduction adoption.

Evaluation: This article is a valuable resource for exploring the public health challenges associated with addiction treatment in the U.S., particularly in the context of opioid overdose prevention. The authors comprehensively review evidence supporting harm reduction approaches and provide actionable steps for policymakers and clinicians. The paper's in-depth discussion of policy changes makes it especially relevant for research on the intersection of healthcare, drug policy, and harm reduction. It effectively highlights the barriers posed by stigma and regulatory restrictions, which may be helpful in discussions about reforming addiction treatment.
