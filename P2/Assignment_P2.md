1a. Design, code, and test a program that contains an array of ints. The size of the array should be the number of characters in your first and last name combined. For example, Maria Beasley (inventor of the life raft, 1880) would have an array of size 12 in her program. Use a named constant for the size of your array.

Use a loop to let the user enter values to fill the contents of the array. As the user is entering values, accumulate (total) each value. 

Use a second loop to output the contents of the array, along with the total and average of the values in the array.

Be sure to use your named constant in the declaration of the array, as well as for the loop limit in both of your loops. (80 points)

1b. How did you approach the development of the program in part a? Explain how you designed, coded, and tested the program. What challenges did you have and how did you overcome those challenges? Which code from the textbook did you reference as you developed this one? (be specific) (20 points)
