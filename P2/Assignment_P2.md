Social Issues, Fentanyl Treatment, Rough Draft

Dear Brian,

I have been thinking a lot about you, especially after your recent relapse. I know how much you’ve struggled with staying sober, and I can’t help but reflect on the growing crisis around us—fentanyl addiction—and how it’s taking so many lives, including people close to us. Do you remember Miles? He fought so hard, too, but in the end, fentanyl claimed his life. His death devastated his family, especially his daughter, and it’s heartbreaking to see how this drug crisis destroys lives beyond those directly affected by addiction. It’s impacting families and communities—including ours.

I know you’ve tried 12-step programs like Alcoholics Anonymous (A.A.) in the past, and while they work for some, they may not fully address what’s needed to overcome opioid addiction, especially when it comes to the physical and neurological aspects. That’s why I wanted to bring up another approach that’s gained traction: harm reduction strategies and medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD). While it may not be a perfect solution, it provides additional support to address both the physical and behavioral challenges of addiction. The fentanyl crisis has caused deep and lasting harm to countless individuals, families, and communities, underscoring the urgent need for compassionate, evidence-based approaches like 12-step programs and MOUD to save lives, reduce harm, and foster long-term recovery.

The Fentanyl Crisis and Its Impact

Fentanyl is tearing through communities across the U.S., and it’s not just in big cities anymore. In 2021 alone, over 100,000 people died from overdoses, with many of those deaths involving fentanyl (BBC News, 2023). This crisis is worsened by the fact that users often don’t realize they’re consuming fentanyl; dealers mix it into other drugs, making it more potent and dangerous. Miles’ story is just one example of how this epidemic reaches us all. Miles went through rehab multiple times, leaving each time with renewed hope. He had a plan, attended his A.A. meetings, and followed the steps, but something kept pulling him back. Despite the support from his family and his A.A. group, he couldn’t overcome the cravings that led to his relapse. His struggle—and his loss—profoundly impacted everyone around him. Addiction doesn’t just hurt the person using it; it shatters families and communities.

Limitations of 12-Step Programs

I know that 12-step programs like A.A. have helped people, including myself, but they don’t work for everyone. Programs like A.A. focus on the spiritual side of recovery, which can be powerful, but often overlook the physical dependency that opioids like fentanyl create (Tonigan, 2007). Fentanyl is incredibly potent, and overcoming its grip requires more than just willpower or spiritual healing. That’s where MOUD comes in.

Traditional approaches might help with the mental and emotional aspects of addiction, but fentanyl addiction has a strong physical component that often needs medical intervention. Miles tried hard, but even with all the support from his family and his A.A. group, he couldn’t shake the cravings that ultimately led to his relapse.

A Case for Medications for Opioid Use Disorder (MOUD)

MOUD approaches addiction differently by addressing the physical aspect. Medications like methadone, buprenorphine, and naltrexone help reduce cravings and withdrawal symptoms, providing a foundation for individuals to regain control over their lives (Proctor et al., 2022). Studies demonstrate that MOUD significantly reduces overdose risk and improves long-term recovery rates. Some people view MOUD as simply “replacing one drug with another,” but these medications are carefully monitored and help people stabilize their lives. If Miles had access to MOUD along with his A.A. program, perhaps things could have turned out differently. He might still be here, working on his recovery and being the father and husband he wanted to be. Brian, I think it’s something you should consider. You’ve tried A.A., and while it has its benefits, it may not be enough. MOUD, combined with therapy and a support network, could be the key to overcoming that final hurdle.

Counterarguments and Challenges

I understand that not everyone is on board with using medication to treat addiction. Some argue that MOUD is a crutch and that abstinence-based programs like A.A. provide a more genuine recovery. Critics fear that MOUD could prolong dependency or that people may misuse it instead of achieving long-term sobriety (Tonigan, 2007).

But the reality is we’re losing too many people to fentanyl. Miles didn’t have time to wait, and neither did countless others. Research backs MOUD, and while it isn’t perfect, it’s saving lives. Our goal shouldn’t be only about achieving complete abstinence—it should be about helping people stay alive and giving them a shot at rebuilding their lives.

The Broader Impact of the Fentanyl Crisis

The fentanyl crisis isn’t just an individual issue; it’s a community crisis. Families like Miles’ wife and daughter are left behind to face the emotional and financial impact of addiction. This epidemic burdens not only those close to the person struggling but also healthcare systems, emergency services, and social services. Expanding access to treatments like MOUD, reducing stigma, and supporting harm reduction programs are critical steps in combating this crisis (Proctor et al., 2022).

Conclusion

Brian, I want you to know I believe in you, but you don’t have to face this alone. This crisis is overwhelming, but some effective tools and people care about you. Please consider trying a new approach—whether it’s MOUD, therapy, or another form of support. I don’t want to see you follow the same path as Miles. There’s hope, and I know you can find it. Let’s work together to get you the help you need. This crisis may seem too big to handle alone, but you have a chance with support, natural solutions, and people who believe in you. I’m here for you and ready to face this journey with you.

Christen,
