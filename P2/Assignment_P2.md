Drip Ybor City, Tampa, Florida
October 20, 2024

Drip is a creative studio in the historic district of Ybor in Tampa, Florida. The studio focuses on hands-on artistic experiences, mostly with pottery and ceramics, and has a laid-back atmosphere designed to inspire creativity and artistic expression. Drip stands for "Do Inspirational Projects," whose mission is to foster a creative and artistic environment. From the moment you walk in, you can tell the environment is unique, and since it is in Ybor, a fantastic variety of individuals frequent the establishment, further contributing to your experience. Initially, my wife and I went to Drip as a "date night" experience to try something new that neither of us had done before. We enjoyed this time together, and the unique, laid-back venue located in the historic district, with all the brick buildings and streets, contributed to the time we spent stepping outside our comfort zone. Drip is the perfect place for individuals or couples to try something new and creative. It is a unique small business unique to the historic district of Ybor. While there, you can also visit many other unique small businesses. Just be sure to wear clothes you aren't afraid to get dirty, and if you plan to visit different places in Ybor, it might be best to see them first, as you'll likely get some clay on yourself through the creative process.
