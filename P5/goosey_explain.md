// !/usr/bin/env Program C
//This line looks like it's intended to be a shebang (commonly used in scripting languages to indicate which interpreter to use). However, C programs are compiled and run via a compiler (like GCC), so this line is unnecessary for C programs and can be removed.

// Purpose: multiplication
// Input: type int value
// Output: 321 Multiplied
//These are comments that describe basic information about the program, including its name, author, purpose, input type, and output. Comments do not affect program execution; they are just notes for the reader.
//c
//Copy code
//#include <stdio.h>
//This is a preprocessor directive that tells the compiler to include the standard input-output library (stdio.h). This library provides functions like printf() and scanf(), which are used for input and output in the program.
//c
//Copy code
// symbolic constant defined
//#define MULTIPLIER 321
//This defines a symbolic constant MULTIPLIER with the value 321. The preprocessor replaces every occurrence of MULTIPLIER with 321 before the program is compiled. Using symbolic constants makes the program easier to maintain because if you want to change the multiplier value, you only need to change it in one place.
//c
//Copy code
// prototype function
//void goosey(int num);
//This is a function prototype for the goosey() function. It informs the compiler that there is a function called goosey that takes an integer (int) as an argument and returns nothing (void). Declaring prototypes before main() helps the compiler recognize function calls.
//c
//Copy code
//int main() {
//This is the start of the main() function, the entry point of any C program. The program starts executing from here.
//c
//Copy code
// int userValue;
//A variable userValue of type int (integer) is declared. It will store the number that the user inputs.
//c
//Copy code
    // enter an integer value
   // printf("Enter an integer value: ");
//This line prints a message to the user asking them to enter an integer value. printf() is the function used to output text to the console.
//c
//Copy code
   // scanf("%d", &userValue);
//This line reads the integer value input by the user and stores it in the variable userValue. The scanf() function reads the input from the user. The format specifier %d indicates that an integer is expected. The &userValue passes the address of the variable so that scanf() can modify the value stored at that memory location.
//c
//Copy code
    // goosey function
//    goosey(userValue);
//The goosey() function is called here, passing the user-provided value userValue as an argument. This function will perform the multiplication and display the result.
//c
//Copy code
//    return 0;
//This returns 0 from the main() function, indicating successful execution of the program. In C, returning 0 typically means that the program ran successfully.
//c
//Copy code
//}
//This marks the end of the main() function.
//c
//Copy code
// function multiplied the value and symbolic constant
//void goosey(int num) {
//This is the definition of the goosey() function. It takes an integer argument num and does not return anything (since its return type is void).
//c
//Copy code
  //  int result = num * MULTIPLIER;
//A local variable result is declared and assigned the value of num (the value passed to the function) multiplied by the symbolic constant MULTIPLIER (which is 321 in this case).
//c
//Copy code
  //  printf("The result of %d multiplied by %d is: %d\n", num, MULTIPLIER, result);
//This line prints the result of the multiplication to the console. The format specifiers %d are placeholders for integers, which are replaced by num, MULTIPLIER, and result when the function is executed. This outputs a message like: "The result of 5 multiplied by 321 is: 1605".
//c
//Copy code

//This marks the end of the goosey() function.

//A comment indicating the end of the program. It's not necessary but helps make the code more readable.
